I am an amatuer programmer. 
My main programming languages are C++ and Java, but i also know web languages (both markdown and programming ones). My experience is good enough to make a simple but optimised game or a mod for a game, but I could not help in most of complex Stack Overflow questions.
I enjoy coding in Java the most but my favourite language is C++ because it is low-level enough to make me fell the control.
I am currently working on a game engine with friends and we are going to make a game using it soon. I am also going to work on a few minecraft mods (for fabric loader) in free time.  
I also like playing games. My favourite one is Minecraft, but I also play Factorio, Terraria, Noita, Baba Is You and Unturned from time to time.  
I use Linux Mint operating system.
