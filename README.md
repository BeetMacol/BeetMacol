Hi, I'm Macol.

I do not host my projects on GitHub anymore and will only use this account for contribution to other people's projects.  
You can find stuff on [my own Forgejo instance](https://beetness.org/) ([Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) is a FOSS, self-hosted alternative for GitHub). That's also where my friends host their stuff.
